To achieve this, we will need several Python files and libraries. The core libraries we will use are pandas for data manipulation, sklearn for machine learning, and streamlit for the user interface. We will also use numpy for numerical operations and seaborn for data visualization.

Here are the files we will need:

1. main.py: This is the entry point of our application. It will handle the user interface and call the appropriate functions based on user input.

2. data_cleaning.py: This file will contain functions for cleaning the dataset.

3. feature_engineering.py: This file will contain functions for feature engineering.

4. model.py: This file will contain functions for training the regression model and calculating RMSE and R2.

5. requirements.txt: This file will list all the Python libraries that our application depends on.

Let's start with the main.py file:
